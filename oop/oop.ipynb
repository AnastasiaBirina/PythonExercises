    "Similarly, we can declare a member as private with two leading underscores self.__x. This is more than just a convention in Python because of a mechanism called name mangling. Members that are preceded with two underscores have their names modified in the background to obj._Classname__x. While they can still be publicly accessed, the purpose of this mechanism is to prevent clashing member names of any inheriting classes that might define a member of the same name."
